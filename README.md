# üõ°Ô∏è Domestic Violence Against Women

## üîç Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data related to domestic violence against women. By examining the dataset, the goal is to identify patterns, understand the demographic and socio-economic factors associated with domestic violence, and provide insights that could help in addressing this critical social issue.

## üìù Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset to summarize its main characteristics and identify key patterns and trends.
3. **Detailed Analysis**: Conduct deeper analysis to uncover significant relationships and insights.
4. **Visualizations**: Create comprehensive visualizations to represent findings and insights from the analysis.
5. **Additional Analysis**: Utilize advanced techniques like anomaly detection, feature engineering, and hypothesis testing to uncover further insights.

## üìÑ Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing various socio-economic and demographic attributes related to women who have experienced domestic violence:

- `Domestic violence.csv`: This dataset includes detailed information on attributes like age, education, employment, marital status, income, and the experience of domestic violence.

## üìã Methodology
The project follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loading the dataset.
   - Inspecting the data to get an overview.
   - Handling missing values and removing duplicates.
   - Converting data types to appropriate formats.
   - Standardizing column names for consistency.
   - Detecting and handling outliers.
   - Normalizing or standardizing data for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing the distribution of demographic variables such as age, education, and income.
   - Investigating the relationships between socio-economic factors and the experience of domestic violence.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - Performing chi-square tests to examine associations between categorical variables.
   - Conducting logistic regression to model the probability of experiencing violence.
   - Applying cluster analysis to identify natural groupings within the data.
   - Assessing feature importance to determine key predictors of domestic violence.

4. **Visualizations**:
   - Creating plots to visualize the distribution and relationships of key variables.
   - Visualizing clusters and patterns in the data.

5. **Additional Analysis**:
   - Engaging in advanced feature engineering to capture complex relationships.
   - Using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE for visualization.
   - Implementing anomaly detection to identify unusual data points.
   - Conducting hypothesis testing to statistically validate assumptions about the data.
